NedOS - My hobby operating system
   Primarily a workbench for exploring how the PC platform works

mkcd   - build into a CD ISO image (latest development)
mkflop - build into a FAT12 floppy image (first development)
mkhd   - build into a hard drive image (side development)
osinfo - a CD image which just dumps configuration information

Of possible use to other people is my bootloader: one sector (512B), sets
the video mode, and readies the kernel for 64 bit mode.
