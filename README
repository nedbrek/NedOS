NedOS - My hobby operating system
   Primarily a workbench for exploring how the PC platform works

mkcd   - build into a CD ISO image (latest development)
mkflop - build into a FAT12 floppy image (first development)
mkhd   - build into a hard drive image (side development)
osinfo - a CD image which just dumps configuration information

Of possible use to other people is my bootloader: one sector (512B), sets
the video mode, and readies the kernel for 64 bit mode.

The best source I've found for OS development is:
http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page

I use Bochs for testing the os image (see the OSDev Bochs page).

To build:
cd mkcd
make run
cp test.iso <bochs area>

I use Bochs magic instructions (xchg bx,bx) for debugging.  You should use them
too.  You will need to continue several times to reach the end (jmp end).
